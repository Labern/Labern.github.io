<h2>What'sMyPurpose.Life is a website dedicated to helping you find and connect with your purpose.</h2>
<h2>Our philosophy is that <strong>you already have a purpose</strong> and that you need to find it in order to become strong and flourish — that is,
to feel strong and become resistant to depression and other mental health issues.</h2>
<h2>This is not therapy. This is not <em>existentialism</em> (the creation of meaning): this is the <em>discovery</em> of meaning that already exists.
We won't solve your existential crisis—we will end them for good.</h2>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline">How will it work?</h2>
<h3>What'sMyPurpose.Life will provide tools and products for you to use to help you get to the root cause of any psychological issues you have,
  which often result in what is now called "mental illness". The concept of a mental illness is a metaphor: the mind cannot become ill, in the technical sense,
  because the mind is not a physical entity. This is not to disrespect the subject of "mental health": it is to revolutionise it
   by changing the way we approach it. If "mental illness" are not really illnesses, what are they? What causes the negative effects of conditions
  like depression, stress, and despair.</h3>
<h3>What'sMyPurpose.Life will go beyond the metaphor of a mental illness to address your philosophical underpinning—that which lies deeper than your current psychological state. To state it simply: if you do not have the answers to a few core philosophical questions (such as "Who am I?", "Why am I here?", "What do I do better than anyone else?"), you are susceptible to the psychological issues prevalant today,
 especially nihilism, depression, despair, and the feeling that you do not know why you are alive.</h3>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline">What tools will this site launch with?</h2>
 <h3>The tools we plan to launch with will include courses about new ways of thinking, essays and videos that explain, and exercises you can perform to better understand the things holding you back.
    We will start with a few core tools and build outwards based on feedback. All of the tools are based on tried and tested methods that we have develoepd over the last decade.
    Almost all of these tools are based on ideas that are not found in any book, app, or service currently available. This is a truly revolutionary approach to solving these issues. If you are tired
    of antidepressants, therapy, and clichés, WhatsMyPurpose.Life will help you find the answers you are looking for.
  </h3>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Is this just another mental health app?</h2>
<h3>This will not be a therapy app, a portal for escapism, or anything like the usual solutions. This will be a one-of-a-kind method
   to help you know—and then create—the person you long to be. This is a <em>sui generis</em> approach to important issues, not another copy-and-paste app.
   What'sMyPurpose.Life has the outspoken aim of changing the way you think about life itself.</h3>
